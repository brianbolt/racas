createSubjectContainerInteraction(subject, container, lsType,

}
\description{
create subject container interaction
}
\details{
interactionStates is ignored for now,
could add back later (as lsStates) with roo update.

This is super sensitive to subject and container being nested- only known to
work with containers and subjects that only have an id and version.
